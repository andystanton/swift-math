# swift-math

A swift math package usable from Swift Playgrounds 4 Apps. As this is a hacky work in progress, every source commit generates a new tag which can be updated to in Swift Playgrounds.

## Installation

- Create a new Playground App or open an existing one (must be running latest Swift Playgrounds - 5.6 at the time of writing).
- Choose the Add button from the side bar.
- Choose Swift Package.
- Enter the Package URL as `https://github.com/andystanton/swift-math`.
- Hit return.
- Choose the latest version from the list, and select allow updates to the next Major version.
- You can now use `import SwiftMath` in your Playground code to access the library.

## Updating

- Long press on the Packages item in the side bar.
- Choose 'Update All Package Dependencies'.

## Removal

- Long press on the `swift-math` in the side bar.
- Choose 'Remove Package Dependency'.
- Confirm this choice.

Note: In Playgrounds 4.1 on iPad, after doing 'Update All Package Dependencies', the 'Remove Package Dependency' does not display until you close and re-open the project.
